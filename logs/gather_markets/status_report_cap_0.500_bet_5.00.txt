Notes:
  • This assumes you BUY NO with a limit price 'cap' and max spend 'bet' per market.
  • 'full_cost' is what you'd spend if you bought ALL NO under that cap.
  • 'effective_cost' is min(bet, full_cost); you never spend more than bet.
  • Per-market debug shows PL_if_NO and PL_if_YES for that effective position.
